Japanese Homework
-----------------

My company, Vitei, has recently started offering Japanese lessons for all
non-Japanese employees (and English lessons for Japanese employees).  This is
just a repo to keep track of any homework I'm set as part of the course.  No
doubt the stuff on here will be full of mistakes, so I wouldn't look at it if
you want to learn Japanese!

If you are Japanese and you feel like correcting me at all, I accept pull
requests  ;-)
